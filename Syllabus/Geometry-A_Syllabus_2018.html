        <h4>COURSE DESCRIPTION</h4>
        <hr>
        <p><i><strong>Course Objectives:</strong></i></p>
        <p>The goal of this course to extend students prior learning from middle school geometry to more formal geometric proofs that use rigid motions and their precise definitions, the study to figures on the Euclidean Plane with a focus on transformation, and the connection of algebraic function to geometry. While engaging in this content, students will apply the eight Mathematical Practices to enhance their analytical reasoning skills.</p>
        <p><i><strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong></i> By the end of this course you should be able to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>use transformations to create figures, find values and defend rigid motion and congruence.</li>
            <li>apply algebra to create and solve equations to find missing measurements in geometric figures.</li>
            <li>apply geometric theorems to prove two triangles congruent using formal and informal proofs.</li>
            <li>apply geometric theorems to prove two triangles similar using formal and informal proofs. </li>
            <li>utilize geometric concepts and algebra to problem solve through a real world/work force application project.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>COURSE STRUCTURE</h4>
        <hr>
        <p><i><strong>Method of Study:</strong></i></p>
        <p>This course is conducted entirely online, which means you do not have to be on school grounds to complete MOST of it. You will participate in the course using OFY/OFLâ€™s learning management system called CANVAS.
        </p>
        <p>This semester-long course is divided into five units. The number of lessons vary from unit to unit. Every unit is comprised of instruction, examples, self-checks which include guided practice, and independent practice/ checks for understanding with linked support and remediation. The student must complete each Learning Target Assessment to obtain unit credit allowing for credit for the course.</p>

                <li>Never wait until the last minute to complete your assignments. You may have a technical problem or run out of time which will cause frustration.
                </li>

            </ul>
            <li>
                <p><i><strong>Active learner:</strong></i> Online students must be active learners, self-starters who are not shy or afraid to ask questions when they do not understand.</p>
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Remember that you, not the instructor, must be in control of your learning process.
                </li>
                <li>Since your instructor cannot see you, you need to "speak up" right away if you have problems and be as explicit as possible; otherwise there is no way others will know that something is wrong.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            <strong><i>FERPA:</i></strong> The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. Â§ 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education. FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's education records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. Students to whom the rights have transferred are "eligible students."
